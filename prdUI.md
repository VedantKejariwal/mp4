Of course. Based on a review of the project PDF and the demo link provided, you are correct: the PDF does not give explicit instructions on *how* the UI should look, but it provides a link to a finished demo (`https://cs391-weather-app.vercel.app/`) as a visual target.

The following is a **new, brief PRD specifically for the UI design**. It is based on replicating the elegant, minimalist style of that demo application using only basic code and the Tailwind CSS framework that was included in the project setup. This document can be given to your AI coding assistant to style the functional website.

### UI Design PRD: Minimalist Weather Application

#### 1. Guiding Principles for UI/UX

*   **Visual Target:** The final design must closely resemble the aesthetic of the official demo application: [https://cs391-weather-app.vercel.app/](https://cs391-weather-app.vercel.app/).
*   **Theme:** The application will have a clean, modern, dark theme.
*   **Simplicity is Paramount:** All styling must be achieved using basic Tailwind CSS utility classes. Do not write complex custom CSS or use advanced styling libraries like Framer Motion. The goal is a clean, static-looking design.
*   **No Advanced Code:** Use only fundamental Tailwind classes for layout (Flexbox, Grid), spacing (padding, margin), typography (font size, color), and borders. Avoid custom animations or complex UI components.
*   **Human-Like Code:** The resulting JSX with Tailwind classes should be simple and readable.

#### 2. Overall Layout and Global Styles

*   **Background:** The entire application body should have a dark, charcoal-gray background (e.g., `bg-gray-900`).
*   **Text:** Default text color should be a light gray or off-white (e.g., `text-gray-200`).
*   **Layout:** All content should be centered on the page within a main container that has a maximum width to prevent it from looking too wide on large screens.

#### 3. Component-Specific Design

**A. Home Page (`/app/page.tsx`)**

This page is the main entry point and should be clean and focused.

*   **Layout:** The content should be centered both vertically and horizontally on the page. Use Flexbox: `flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen`.
*   **Title:** A large, bold heading (e.g., `<h1>`) that says "Weather App". Use Tailwind classes like `text-5xl font-bold`.
*   **Subtitle:** A smaller, less prominent subheading (e.g., `<p>`) below the title that says "Enter a city name to get the forecast". Use classes like `text-lg text-gray-400 mt-2`.
*   **Search Form:** The `SearchForm` component will be rendered below the subtitle.

**B. Search Form Component (`SearchForm.tsx`)**

*   **Layout:** The input field and the "Get Weather" button should be aligned horizontally. Use Flexbox: `flex mt-8`.
*   **Input Field (`<input>`):**
    *   Dark background, slightly lighter than the page background (e.g., `bg-gray-800`).
    *   No visible border, or a very subtle one (e.g., `border border-gray-700`).
    *   Rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-l-md`).
    *   Sufficient padding for comfortable typing (e.g., `p-3`).
    *   Light text color.
*   **Button (`<button>`):**
    *   A distinct background color to make it stand out, like a solid blue (e.g., `bg-blue-600`).
    *   White text, bold font (e.g., `text-white font-bold`).
    *   Rounded corners that match the input field on the right side (e.g., `rounded-r-md`).
    *   A subtle hover effect, like making the background slightly lighter (e.g., `hover:bg-blue-500`).

**C. Weather Results Page (`/app/weather/[city]/page.tsx`)**

*   **Layout:** Content should be at the top of the page, not vertically centered.
*   **Back Link:** Include a simple link at the top left that navigates back to the home page (`/`).
*   **Weather Card:** The `WeatherCard` component will be the main element on this page.

**D. Weather Card Component (`WeatherCard.tsx`)**

This component displays all the weather information.

*   **Container:** The card should be a container with:
    *   A background color slightly lighter than the page background (e.g., `bg-gray-800`).
    *   Generous padding (e.g., `p-8`).
    *   Rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-lg`).
    *   A subtle border (e.g., `border border-gray-700`).
*   **Content:**
    *   **City Name:** Large and bold at the top (e.g., `text-4xl font-bold`).
    *   **Main Temperature:** Very large font below the city name (e.g., `text-7xl font-extrabold mt-4`).
    *   **Weather Description:** (e.g., "Clear Sky"). Subdued text below the temperature.
    *   **Feels Like:** Subdued text below the description.
    *   **Details Grid:** Create a simple two-column grid (`grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-8`) to neatly display additional stats like High/Low, Humidity, and Wind Speed. Each item in the grid should have a label (e.g., "Humidity") and its value.

**E. Loading and Error State UI**

*   **Loading:** While data is being fetched, display a simple text message like "Loading...".
*   **Error:** If an error occurs (e.g., city not found), display a clear, centered error message like "City not found. Please try again." and provide a link to go back home. Do not show a broken UI.

#### 4. Git & Deployment Commands

The workflow for testing and deploying remains the same.

1.  **Run Locally for Testing:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Add and Commit Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement UI design and styling"
    ```
3.  **Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    (Vercel will automatically redeploy the new version from GitHub).
